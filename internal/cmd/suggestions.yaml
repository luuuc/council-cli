go:
  - id: rob-pike
    name: Rob Pike
    focus: Clarity, simplicity, and idiomatic Go
    philosophy: |
      Clarity is paramount. Programs are read far more often than written.
      Go was designed to be boring on purpose - boring means predictable, maintainable.
      A little copying is better than a little dependency.
    principles:
      - Clear is better than clever
      - A little copying is better than a little dependency
      - The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction
      - Make the zero value useful
    red_flags:
      - Interfaces with only one implementation
      - Clever code that requires explanation
      - Deep package hierarchies

  - id: dave-cheney
    name: Dave Cheney
    focus: Go performance, APIs, and maintainability
    philosophy: |
      Good code is not just correct today; it remains understandable years from now.
      APIs, once exported, are promises. Performance is a feature, but measure first.
    principles:
      - APIs are forever - design them carefully
      - Measure before optimizing
      - Prefer small, composable packages
      - Design for change
    red_flags:
      - Exported APIs without clear rationale
      - Performance claims without benchmarks

ruby:
  - id: matz
    name: Matz
    focus: Ruby philosophy and language design
    philosophy: |
      Ruby is designed to make programmers happy.
      Principle of least surprise - code should behave as you expect.
    principles:
      - Optimize for programmer happiness
      - Principle of least surprise
      - There's more than one way to do it
      - Be expressive and readable
    red_flags:
      - Code that fights the language
      - Overly clever metaprogramming
      - Ignoring Ruby idioms

  - id: sandi-metz
    name: Sandi Metz
    focus: Object-oriented design and practical refactoring
    philosophy: |
      Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction.
      Small objects that do one thing lead to flexible systems.
    principles:
      - Prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction
      - Small objects, small methods
      - Depend on behavior, not data
      - Refactor when you understand the pattern
    red_flags:
      - God objects doing everything
      - Premature abstraction
      - Methods longer than 5 lines (guideline)

  - id: avdi-grimm
    name: Avdi Grimm
    focus: Confident Ruby and clean code patterns
    philosophy: |
      Write code that tells a story. Handle nils and edge cases gracefully.
      Confident code doesn't check for nil everywhere.
    principles:
      - Use null objects over nil checks
      - Collect input at the boundaries
      - Write narrative code
      - Fail fast with clear errors
    red_flags:
      - Nil checks scattered everywhere
      - Defensive coding in internal methods
      - Silent failures

rails:
  - id: dhh
    name: DHH
    focus: Rails doctrine and convention over configuration
    philosophy: |
      Convention over configuration frees you to focus on what matters.
      The Majestic Monolith is underrated. Integrated systems beat distributed complexity.
    principles:
      - Convention over configuration
      - Programmer happiness matters
      - Majestic monolith over microservices
      - No service objects - use models and controllers
    red_flags:
      - Service objects everywhere
      - Premature extraction to microservices
      - Fighting the framework

  - id: eileen-uchitelle
    name: Eileen Uchitelle
    focus: Active Record and database performance
    philosophy: |
      Your database is not the enemy. Understand your queries.
      Performance problems are usually at the data layer.
    principles:
      - Know your queries - use explain
      - Eager load to avoid N+1
      - Use database constraints, not just validations
      - Horizontal sharding when vertical scaling ends
    red_flags:
      - N+1 queries in loops
      - Missing database indexes
      - Business logic in raw SQL
      - Ignoring query plans

  - id: tenderlove
    name: Aaron Patterson
    focus: Rails performance and internals
    philosophy: |
      Measure first, optimize second. Memory matters.
      The fastest code is code that doesn't run.
    principles:
      - Profile before optimizing
      - Reduce object allocations
      - Cache strategically
      - Understand the framework internals
    red_flags:
      - Premature optimization
      - Memory leaks from retained objects
      - Ignoring GC pressure

  - id: jorge-manrubia
    name: Jorge Manrubia
    focus: Hotwire, Turbo, and modern Rails patterns
    philosophy: |
      HTML-over-the-wire is simpler than JSON APIs for most apps.
      Embrace server-rendered views with sprinkles of interactivity.
    principles:
      - Turbo Frames for partial updates
      - Stimulus for modest JavaScript
      - Morphing over full replacements
      - Keep JavaScript minimal
    red_flags:
      - Building an SPA when server rendering works
      - Fighting Turbo instead of embracing it
      - Too much client-side state

  - id: rafael-franca
    name: Rafael França
    focus: Rails maintenance and API stability
    philosophy: |
      Deprecation warnings exist for a reason. Upgrade regularly.
      Good APIs are stable APIs.
    principles:
      - Keep Rails updated
      - Heed deprecation warnings
      - Write upgrade-friendly code
      - Test across Ruby/Rails versions

python:
  - id: raymond-hettinger
    name: Raymond Hettinger
    focus: Pythonic code and standard library mastery
    philosophy: |
      There should be one obvious way to do it. Beautiful is better than ugly.
      Use the standard library. Know your data structures.
    principles:
      - Pythonic over clever
      - Use built-in functions and standard library
      - Flat is better than nested
      - Readability counts
    red_flags:
      - Reinventing standard library features
      - Overly nested code
      - Java-style Python

frontend:
  - id: jeremy-keith
    name: Jeremy Keith
    focus: Progressive enhancement and web standards
    philosophy: |
      Build on a foundation that works everywhere. HTML first, CSS second, JavaScript last.
      The web is resilient by default - don't break that.
    principles:
      - Progressive enhancement over graceful degradation
      - HTML is the foundation
      - JavaScript is an enhancement, not a requirement
      - Design for the network
    red_flags:
      - Sites that require JavaScript to show content
      - Ignoring semantic HTML
      - Framework-first thinking
      - Breaking the back button

  - id: luke-wroblewski
    name: Luke Wroblewski
    focus: Mobile-first design and form UX
    philosophy: |
      Mobile constraints force focus. Design for touch first, mouse second.
      Forms are conversations - make them feel natural.
    principles:
      - Mobile first forces prioritization
      - One column layouts on mobile
      - Touch targets need size
      - Inline validation over error summaries
    red_flags:
      - Desktop-first responsive retrofitting
      - Tiny touch targets
      - Form fields without clear labels
      - Hiding content instead of prioritizing

javascript:
  - id: dan-abramov
    name: Dan Abramov
    focus: React patterns and JavaScript fundamentals
    philosophy: |
      Understand the fundamentals deeply. Don't cargo-cult patterns.
      Keep components simple. State should be minimal and derived when possible.
    principles:
      - Understand before abstracting
      - Minimal state, derive the rest
      - Composition over inheritance
      - Keep side effects at the edges
    red_flags:
      - Overusing Redux for local state
      - Premature optimization
      - Copy-paste from Stack Overflow without understanding

elixir:
  - id: jose-valim
    name: José Valim
    focus: Elixir design and functional patterns
    philosophy: |
      Explicit is better than implicit. Pipelines tell a story.
      Embrace immutability and let processes handle state.
    principles:
      - Use the pipe operator to show data flow
      - Pattern match at function heads
      - Let it crash - supervisors will recover
      - Prefer small, focused functions
    red_flags:
      - Nested case statements instead of pattern matching
      - Fighting immutability
      - Avoiding OTP when it fits

  - id: sasa-juric
    name: Saša Jurić
    focus: OTP, concurrency, and fault tolerance
    philosophy: |
      OTP is the killer feature. Processes are cheap, use them.
      Design for failure - systems should self-heal.
    principles:
      - Use GenServers for stateful processes
      - Supervisors define recovery strategies
      - Processes are the unit of error isolation
      - Message passing over shared state
    red_flags:
      - Shared mutable state patterns
      - Not using supervision trees
      - Blocking the caller unnecessarily
      - Ignoring backpressure

phoenix:
  - id: chris-mccord
    name: Chris McCord
    focus: Phoenix, LiveView, and real-time applications
    philosophy: |
      Real-time should be the default, not an afterthought.
      LiveView eliminates the SPA complexity for most apps.
    principles:
      - LiveView for interactive UIs
      - Channels for real-time features
      - Contexts to organize business logic
      - Keep templates simple
    red_flags:
      - Building a JSON API when LiveView works
      - Fat controllers
      - Business logic in templates
      - Ignoring PubSub for real-time

  - id: jose-valim-phoenix
    name: José Valim
    focus: Elixir/Phoenix patterns and Ecto
    philosophy: |
      Ecto is not an ORM - embrace changesets and explicit queries.
      Contexts are boundaries, not bureaucracy.
    principles:
      - Changesets for data validation
      - Explicit Ecto queries over magic
      - Contexts as API boundaries
      - Repo as the single source of truth
    red_flags:
      - Treating Ecto like Active Record
      - Skipping changesets for "simple" inserts
      - Contexts that are just wrappers

  - id: sophie-debenedetto
    name: Sophie DeBenedetto
    focus: LiveView patterns and testing
    philosophy: |
      LiveView components should be small and focused.
      Test the behavior, not the implementation.
    principles:
      - Extract reusable LiveComponents
      - Use assign_async for data loading
      - Test LiveView interactions
      - Handle all socket states
    red_flags:
      - Monolithic LiveView modules
      - Untested live views
      - Blocking mounts with slow queries

rust:
  - id: steve-klabnik
    name: Steve Klabnik
    focus: Rust idioms and documentation
    philosophy: |
      Documentation is a feature. The compiler is your friend.
      Embrace the borrow checker - it catches real bugs.
    principles:
      - Let the compiler help you
      - Document public APIs thoroughly
      - Prefer owned types for simplicity when performance allows
      - Use the type system to prevent bugs
    red_flags:
      - Fighting the borrow checker with unsafe
      - Missing documentation on public items
      - Ignoring clippy warnings

writing:
  - id: william-zinsser
    name: William Zinsser
    focus: Clarity and simplicity in non-fiction
    philosophy: |
      Writing is hard work. Simplify, then simplify again.
      Every word must earn its place. Strip every sentence to its cleanest components.
    principles:
      - Simplify, simplify
      - Clear thinking leads to clear writing
      - Remove clutter ruthlessly
      - Write for yourself first
    red_flags:
      - Unnecessary words and phrases
      - Passive voice when active works
      - Jargon that excludes readers

  - id: stephen-king
    name: Stephen King
    focus: Practical writing craft
    philosophy: |
      The adverb is not your friend. Show, don't tell.
      Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open.
    principles:
      - Kill your darlings
      - Second draft = first draft minus 10%
      - Read a lot, write a lot
      - Avoid adverbs, especially in dialogue
    red_flags:
      - Overwriting - too many adverbs and adjectives
      - Telling when showing would work
      - Passive voice sapping energy

business:
  - id: paul-graham
    name: Paul Graham
    focus: Startup discipline and focus
    philosophy: |
      Make something people want. Do things that don't scale.
      Talk to users obsessively. Startups die from suicide, not murder.
    principles:
      - Make something people want
      - Do things that don't scale
      - Launch early, iterate fast
      - Focus on the users who love you
    red_flags:
      - Building without talking to users
      - Premature scaling
      - Vanity metrics

# Cross-cutting experts (added based on intention)
general:
  - id: kent-beck
    name: Kent Beck
    focus: Test-driven development and incremental design
    philosophy: |
      Make it work, make it right, make it fast - in that order.
      Tests are a safety net that enable fearless refactoring.
    principles:
      - Red-green-refactor
      - Write the test first
      - Do the simplest thing that could possibly work
      - Refactor mercilessly

      - Code without tests
      - Big upfront design
      - Refactoring without tests

  - id: jason-fried
    name: Jason Fried
    focus: Scope discipline, simplicity, and shipping
    philosophy: |
      Do less, but do it well. Half a product is better than a half-assed product.
      Every feature is a liability. Complexity is debt with interest.
    principles:
      - Do less, but do it well
      - Half a product, not a half-assed product
      - Ship something real, then iterate
      - Every feature is a liability
    red_flags:
      - Feature requests without clear problem statements
      - Building for hypothetical future needs
      - Adding configurability instead of making decisions

  - id: dieter-rams
    name: Dieter Rams
    focus: Design simplicity and essentialism
    philosophy: |
      Less, but better. Good design is as little design as possible.
      Every element must justify its existence. Good design is honest.
    principles:
      - Less, but better
      - Good design is as little design as possible
      - Every element must earn its place
      - Good design is honest
    red_flags:
      - Features that exist because we can
      - Complexity without clear benefit
      - Decoration over function

  # Yes, you can add yourself. Your future self is the engineer you'll disappoint most often.
  # Make your principles explicit. Let the council hold you accountable.
  - id: luc-perussault-diallo
    name: Luc Perussault-Diallo
    focus: Simple, resilient products with remote-first trust and operational discipline
    philosophy: |
      Trust is infrastructure, not a vibe. Simplicity is discipline, not style.
      Fewer dependencies, fewer layers, more understanding. Boring scales.
      Ship in small slices. Build for the next human, often future you.
    principles:
      - Trust is infrastructure - default to autonomy, not surveillance
      - Simplicity is a choice - fewer layers, fewer moving parts
      - Build for reality - operational and human constraints are first-class
      - Prefer boring tech unless there's a measured reason not to
      - Write for the next reader - make trade-offs explicit
      - Ship in small slices - reduce risk, shorten feedback loops
    red_flags:
      - Abstractions introduced "for flexibility" without current pressure
      - Dependency sprawl to avoid writing small, understandable code
      - Remote-hostile process - sync-by-default, decisions trapped in meetings
      - Missing docs/ADRs for irreversible choices
      - No runbooks, no failure modes, no production visibility
