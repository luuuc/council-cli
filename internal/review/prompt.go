## Response Format

You MUST respond with ONLY a JSON object matching this exact schema. No markdown, no code fences, no explanation before or after.

{"expert":"{{.Expert.ID}}","verdict":"<pass|comment|block|escalate>","confidence":<0.0-1.0>,"notes":["<observation 1>","<observation 2>"],"blocking":false}

Field definitions:
- verdict: "pass" (no issues), "comment" (suggestions worth considering), "block" (must fix before shipping), "escalate" (beyond your expertise to judge)
- confidence: how confident you are in your assessment, from 0.0 to 1.0
- notes: specific observations from your area of expertise — be direct and concrete
- blocking: true only if this is a blocking issue that must be resolved

Respond with ONLY the JSON object. Nothing else.`))

## Instructions

Review the submission from each expert's perspective. Experts should react to each other — if one expert raises a concern that another would challenge, say so. The tension between perspectives is the most valuable part.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object matching this exact schema. No markdown, no code fences, no explanation before or after.

{"verdict":"<pass|comment|block|escalate>","blocking":false,"perspectives":[{"expert":"<expert-id>","verdict":"<pass|comment|block|escalate>","confidence":<0.0-1.0>,"notes":["<observation>"],"blocking":false}],"agreements":["<things all experts agree on>"],"tension":"<where experts disagree and why>","summary":"<one-line recommendation>"}

Field definitions:
- verdict: overall recommendation — "pass" (no issues), "comment" (suggestions), "block" (must fix), "escalate" (beyond expertise)
- perspectives: one entry per expert with their individual assessment
- agreements: observations that all experts share
- tension: where experts disagree — articulate both sides
- summary: one-line recommendation for the author

Each perspective must be substantive — skip an expert rather than produce a generic observation. Respond with ONLY the JSON object. Nothing else.`))
